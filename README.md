## react-calculator

>***<p align="justify">React-calculator is an app which allows you to do simple arithmetic operations. Besides that, there are two regimes of the calculator: constructor and runtime.
In constructor mode you can drag calculator element and drop it into the droppable area. After that you can sort elements if you don't like theirs order or you can return element back
to area where you took it by doubleclick. Design of the project and idea can be found [here](https://sendsay.notion.site/Frontend-e378a45c3a934dafb6e44f79da2a0040)</p>***
